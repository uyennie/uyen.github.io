        <h1>1. People I love not knowing how much I loved them </h1>
          
          <p>realized lately that if there is anything i want as a takeaway from my being, it's that i loved and i loved so many things and i loved it hard... haha. what a silly dream.</p>

            <h1>2. My mind working against me</h1>
          <p>this one is really fun because it's happening a lot lately. if my head can't even process direct truths in front of me, how am i going to function. haha</p>

        <h1>3. The Ocean</h1>
          
          
          <p>my friends and anyone i've fantasized with on vacations know this. i think my family does but they don't take it seriously. i absolutely cannot step into the ocean, especially if the water is murky and unclear, especially if the water is above my ankles. i feel immediately dizzy and small and i know i will drift</p>
          
          <p>also one time i was held against my will quite far out into the shore as a child and got stung like 30 times with whoever carrying me thinking i was just acting up and not actually being stung to what felt like death to my child body so that is probably a contributing factor</p>
          
          <p class="fancy">just maybe</p>
