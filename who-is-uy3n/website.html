        <h1>1. LibraryOfBabel.info</h1>
          
          <p>after the jorges' short "the library of babel", jonathan basile developed an online library contemplating the variation of the 23 letters... it algorithmically generates all of humanity's greatest secrets&mdash;and an infinite amount of gibberish with it. things are accessible by search or can be narrowed down to the exact hex/wall/shelf/volume. it is ridiculosuly fun, has an incredible theory section, and is a wonderful exercise onto what speculative realms the digital can unlock for us. a huge huge huge influence on the way i think about the web and fiction</p>
          
          <p class="fancy">my favorite thing on the internet.</p>

            <h1>2. orteil.dashnet.org/nested</h1>
          <p>from the maker of cookie clicker, "nested" is a universe simulator unlocked through nested lists. i love love worldbuilding through the web browser, and nested's procedural generation is so <em>fun</em> and readable - you can right-click and spoil it all for yourself if you'd like! my favorite thing too is that nested has its own spin-off wiki (orteilsnested.fandom.com) with hundreds of pages</p>
          
          <p class="fancy">I made a Sound Art piece based off Nested called 'House' lmao it sucks but it fueled my interest in field recordings and open-source sound and tooling. house is at https://chi.itch.io/house</p>
