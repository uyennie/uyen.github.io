          <p>Currently ~151WPM but I've went as high as ~170WPM in sprint rounds. This particular round was done in front of friends and I took my rings off and I definitely looked really sexy and cool and mysterious and not like an anime character destroying my macbook keyboard to a point of no return </p>
