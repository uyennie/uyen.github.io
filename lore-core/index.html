                <div class="a-paragraph">I don’t know how to function without grief.
                    Every good moment in my life has been permeated with a sense of fleetingness and genuine dread that has been impossible for me to evade.
                    I wonder how much of this is because of my Catholic upbringing, where I had to barter any time for joy. It didn’t just instill this need for human beings to labor to find worth, but that any act of pleasure was inherently sinful and must be atoned for. The word ‘high-functioning’ feels like it erases my experiences.
                    Having to constantly offer proof of suffering
                    Talking to my school’s mental health service is like proving that I’m not mad enough to kill myself (so this case isn’t urgent) but proving that I’m still incapacitated enough in day-to-day life
                    And I can’t even prove this right because I seem way too fucking normal and make jokes and shit
                    The way mental health off days are treated like something you heal back from like a cold, not like “this is a terrible dip from something I’ve been facing for decades and everything will be back to normal in a few”
                    Does being so visible necessitate this constant need to show proof of my pain
                    Every act of healing I attempt to go on will be compared against this vessel of myself at my worst, the one that I’ve existed in for decades. It feels like I have to completely destroy my old self / find new spaces because I am so so afraid of being that dying person again
                    Hatred of this trope in the first place. A drastic change and others sensing ‘this isn’t the real you’ when I know myself more than anyone and have been choosing what to present. New every day; wonder how much of my life is just choosing how incrementally to let other people in on this since people can’t process drastic change

                <div class="a-paragraph">I’m proud of a few things, and embarrassed by lots. HyperSext City is the latest project I’ve designed that I’m most proud of. It’s a collaborative project that brought together a passionate group of people from XYX Lab and outside experts. The design has purpose; to inform and communicate data about sexual harassment that otherwise is never seen by the public. As a designer obsessed with the potential for typography, this was an ideal project to really demonstrate how powerful it could be.

                <div class="a-paragraph">Regrets? I have a few. As a young graduate in the late 80s I worked in the Marketing Department of The Age (when it was an actual thriving newspaper). I never questioned the sponsorship of projects, happily plastering cigarette logos over promotions for sporting and cultural events. I also regret asking a staff photographer to photograph a page I’d designed as I set it on fire... inside a studio with smoke alarms. Causing an entire building to evacuate for a design idea was pretty embarrassing. It was for page one... it did look good though. Very authentic.

Question your own decisions and have the guts to say ‘no’ to things that you know are not right. As a designer, consider who is your design is for but more importantly who might you be excluding? And consider the non-human world. We live in a complex and delicate ecology. Being ‘human-centred’ is a mantra that can only be enacted if the non-human is carefully woven into that centre also. Landfill is arguably full of things designed as ‘human centred’.

                <div class="a-paragraph">52 years. I joined the US Navy ‘to see the world’. As a result, my experiences of some of the greatest cities of the world plus the remains of seminal Western civilizations plunged me into the world of architecture and I wanted to join up. I became a licensed architect and found myself asking questions about design that went beyond the reach of architecture. I went to graduate school at UC Berkeley where I got a second terminal degree in architecture and designed my own Ph.D. degree in Social Systems Design. Since my degree did not fit into any prescribed academic field or professional practice I worked in a variety of established fields until I had the opportunity to design a graduate program in Whole Systems Design. I went on to a career of consulting, teaching and praxis in systemic designing.

                <div class="a-paragraph">My proudest moment as a designer comes on days when I hear stories of people who I have taught or influenced doing great work. I think the world needs more designers, and as a designer there is limited work I can do. The biggest impact I can have is to share my passion for design, the mindset that I should be employed and have those people evangelise design also.

                <div class="a-paragraph">When teaching design I try not to focus too much on the hard skills, or methodologies, but more on the mindset and beliefs which are constantly evolving but look something like this...

These cards were designed to optimise the debt carried by the individual, by creating a situation where they could afford to pay the interest but not the principle.

                    My undergrad is in biomedical engineering and I majored in neurosciences. I was really always interested in the human in the system, whatever that was, so my orientation has always been a fascination around this being and how it experiences living. I thought that perhaps, if I specialised in neurosciences, I'd be able to work that out, because at that stage, I thought the brain did everything and everything I was interested in. While I was in Japan doing research and imaging brains, I had this dream. There was this eyeball suspended on its own in space, and it was just spinning around frantically trying to see itself. And I woke up going, holy shit, this whole field of brain research is futile. It’s like a brain trying to work out how the brain works – and it’s just not for me.
                  <br>
                    <br>I realised that what I was really interested in was understanding the human and designing for that understanding, so that is why I did my PhD in human centred design. I worked with fighter pilots and jets at the Defence Department, DSTO, looking at situational awareness and workload when designing complicated environments to understand what role design could play in improving the system performance – when the human as a system was pushed to its limit, and when technology was pushed to its limit. And then I left because of all sorts of moral and ethical dilemmas that come with the industry. I didn't want the application of my efforts to be in that direction, so I left. And I've been working in design since I submitted my PhD 20 years ago.

                <div class="response">52 years. I joined the US Navy ‘to see the world’. As a result, my experiences of some of the greatest cities of the world plus the remains of seminal Western civilizations plunged me into the world of architecture and I wanted to join up. I became a licensed architect and found myself asking questions about design that went beyond the reach of architecture. I went to graduate school at UC Berkeley where I got a second terminal degree in architecture and designed my own Ph.D. degree in Social Systems Design. Since my degree did not fit into any prescribed academic field or professional practice I worked in a variety of established fields until I had the opportunity to design a graduate program in Whole Systems Design. I went on to a career of consulting, teaching and praxis in systemic designing.

                    I'm surprised that this is the one that's come up as the one that I'm the most proud of, but I was responsible for the rear camera on the Ford Territory, which was the first time that the rear camera was put on an Australian made production vehicle. The reason why I'm proud of that is because at that time, there had been a number of accidents with toddlers being hit in people’s driveways when they were reversing.
                  <br>
                    <br>
                    It took me 18 months to convince the executives to do it, and the constraints that they put on the design were ridiculous. It had to be zero on cost, no new parts, everything carryover, no changes to assembly, no changes to make – it was as if they were trying to make it so that it couldn't happen. The way I got it through was I literally, with a supplier in cahoots, kidnapped the head of purchasing. We put him in a Territory and we put a tricycle in his blind spot, and we said, “Okay, we just want you to do your head check and start reversing.” And he did it, he started to move back. And then I turned the camera on and he saw the tricycle there. And I said, “No on cost, no changes to...” I just read out the engineering constraints. And he said, “Okay” and he signed on the spot.
                  <br>
                    <br>So that for me, you know, was a David and Goliath kind of story where a twenty-nothing, PhD upstart, woman in automotive manufacturing was running around trying to make change – that was huge, and I'm very proud of that.

                    The thing that I regret, it's not a lack of pride because I think the work that I did was really good, but it's actually my PhD when I was at the defence department and the reason I left. To be able to answer my research question – which was a human question about situational awareness and workload, and the role of design in highly technical environments – I developed a technology to be able to spatialize audio so that I could do my experiments.
                  <br>
                    <br>That technology needed to work in the simulator in the air operations division, which meant it needed to be really light from a coding perspective and it needed to be really accurate, and because I was using it for PhD research, it had to run on really cheap equipment. And so, because of the constraints – and this is why I love constraints in design – I had to be really creative with what that was. But then that tiny little piece of code was shared with a French head up display manufacturer, and they connected that code with head mounted weapon systems. I found out like four or five years after I had created it, so I was just sort of in the process of submitting my PhD when I found out where that code had wandered off to. And because I had been offered to stay on at DSTO at that stage, and I kind of just said goodbye and left. So that feels... a bit shit.

I never questioned the sponsorship of projects, happily plastering cigarette logos over promotions for sporting and cultural events. I also regret asking a staff photographer to photograph a page I’d designed as I set it on fire... inside a studio with smoke alarms. Causing an entire building to evacuate for a design idea was pretty embarrassing. It was for page one... it did look good though. Very authentic.

But every single person I've worked with in that capacity, I've learned from. In every single session there's something which just blows my mind. And I guess, from that, the general thing that I keep learning over and over again is the generosity of the human spirit. That when you enable connection, like your heart is open and you're there in service with others, that people are incredibly generous and courageous in their sharing. And it blows me away every single time that I experience that. And I feel like that is in all of us. There are so many layers that we build around us to protect ourselves, that most of the time, we don't get to see that in each other. And I learn that from the people that I work with all the time.

                    The thing that I teach my students, in the context of design ethics, is that the best thing you can do is to continue to deepen your reflective practice and understand who is actually doing the designing. What are the values sitting behind the decisions that you make that have you privilege certain things over others, have you notice certain insights over other insights? Just constantly be doing the work. So that what you put out into the world as a designer is an authentic expression of the impact you want to have, because you know who you are, you know what's informing and designing.
                  <br>
                    <br>
                    I've been doing lots of work this year around surrender and letting go, professionally and personally. And one of the biggest things around that whole experiment has been around letting go of preference like, I really want things to turn out like this, or I would really prefer if this happened, and just learning to let that go. And in design, there can't be any judgement around what that looks like for people in terms of what their values are, and their belief systems are, and how that they manifest and design. It's highly likely there are going to be designers out there that are informed by completely different principles and values that perhaps you and I will be informed by. And there's an acceptance that needs to come with that. Even though, you know, they might be designing mining extraction machinery. Where we sort of go, “Really? We're still... okay, all right, that's still happening... but this is the world that I want to create, so I will put my energy over there.”
                  <br>
                    <br>
                    It's the meta skills that designers need to be able to navigate the tensions and trade offs that they are always going to find themselves in, by the very nature of the job that they do, that we don't teach how to navigate. We don't teach people how to identify when it's your intuition that's speaking to you versus your intellect. We don't teach people how to have conversations when the work that they've been asked to do is in complete violation with their values. We don't teach designers how to respectfully establish the boundaries around their practice, what they will do, what they won't do. But they are the things that I'm talking about in terms of the meta skills.
                  <br>
                    <br>We don't we don't teach designers how to dissolve the visceral tension that's held in their bodies, when as a designer, they need to remain neutral when they're doing their design research or their design action, when they're actually having physical responses to the content that they're working with. We don't talk about how to deal with that. And there's no no clinical supervision in design. In psychology and therapy practices, they have the clinical supervision that happens where they can debrief and get support and whatever. But designers go into family violence contexts and do family violence research, then come back and have to work out what to do with the information about a toddler being bashed to death. But that is the content of the world of design, and there’s just nothing that's there. I feel really strongly about this, I feel like it's irresponsible for design education to not do that because we send designers out into this world saying, go do good! Make big change! Work in social change! Work in the areas that have the most, you know, trauma. But we don't do the other stuff.

                    I think I would just say, really learn how to back yourself. Learn what you need to be able to be your own cheer squad. And the reason why I would say that is because design is a really powerful set of skills and tools and knowledge. And sometimes you will find yourself in a position where you have something to share that's not going to be popular with the people around you, and your skill set is too powerful for you to capitulate too early and too soon. So to be able to hold your ground and say no actually, I know that this is not a popular piece of information, but the work that I've done and the research that I've done, and the insights that are informing this are too important to dismiss, and to really be able to back yourself in those conversations.
                  <br>
                    <br>And there's a real subtlety in what I'm saying. One of the superpowers that I think really amazing designers have is one of humility. To be able to remain humble. And you might think that that sits in paradox with what I just said, which is to back yourself, but humility comes from having a stance of always being open, always learning, always looking for the opportunity to improve. And when you back yourself in a conversation, you actually increase the chances of there being some friction and a learning opportunity, actually, for you to be able to go, okay, the way that this person is responding to what I've just said is quite heightened, what do I have to learn here? Was it in my delivery? Was it in the thing? And so on. So those two things together work beautifully as a part of a reflective practice, which is the other thing that I continue to say, all designers need to have a really strong reflective practice. So they can integrate constantly, and improve.

                <div class="response">Humility... again. Your education begins AFTER you leave the university. Learn from the world; but critique it at the same time. Question your own decisions and have the guts to say ‘no’ to things that you know are not right. As a designer, consider who is your design is for but more importantly who might you be excluding? And consider the non-human world. We live in a complex and delicate ecology. Being ‘human-centred’ is a mantra that can only be enacted if the non-human is carefully woven into that centre also. Landfill is arguably full of things designed as ‘human centred’.

                    After beginning in neurosciences and moving from there into design, I feel like it's coming sort of full circle. After 20 years in the industry, doing design in all sorts of different contexts, I’m now interested in trying to uncover what therapeutic design might be; and that's just a word that I'm using just as a placeholder for trying to work out what the thing is, because I really don't know yet. But there have been so many experiences where I've been facilitating a design process – or even just a session with all sorts of people, from all sorts of different levels and hierarchies and industries, public, private, it doesn't matter where – and they've come up to me at the end of it and said, “I know that wasn't the intention, but that felt like therapy.”
                  <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the things that often gets missed, I think, is that the model of design that we get taught is very centric. It's actually very masculine, but I don't mean that in a gendered way, I mean that in an energetic, masculine way. Like if you think about Yin and Yang, it's very Yang. With this model of design there's a problem, and the problem needs a solution, and we're going to use design to make sure that problem has the best outcome and the best impact. And we go through this Double Diamond Process, and here are the tools, and here are the frameworks, and it's all very methodical. Even though within it we talk about intuition, imagination and ambiguity and all of that sort of stuff.
                  <br>
                    <br>
                    The model of design that we're taught is geared towards problem solving. And I just think that the world needs something different. It feels like we need a design process that is more alongside, supportive and healing, as opposed to an expert “I can help you solve a problem” – especially when you're working with vulnerable communities, or you're working with different cultures, or you're working with indigenous cultures, or you're working with children. My question is how do we move away from a problem solving orientation for design? And what is that?
                  <br>
                    <br>And I'm also playing with this whole notion that the micro is the macro. We often talk about how there's yourself and then your family, and then your community, and then it goes up to encompass the whole world. But we seem to think that design that happens at the super system level looks very different from design that happens at the individual level. I feel as though the same scale that exists outside of us also exists within us, and if we can consider a design approach that acknowledges that change within manifests itself as change outside, and we believe that totally, then it will fundamentally impact the way that we know design today. Because design is very externally oriented as well which is why I wrote This Human which is more about the internal experience of design.

                            Creativity is crucial to business success. But too often, even the most innovative organisation quickly becomes a "giant hairball” – a tangled, impenetrable mass of rules, traditions, and systems, all based on what worked in the past – that exercises an inexorable pull into mediocrity. Gordon McKenzie worked at Hallmark Cards for thirty years, many of which he spent inspiring his colleagues to slip the bonds of Corporate Normalcy and rise to orbit – to a mode of dreaming, daring and doing above and beyond the rubber-stamp confines of the administrative mind-set. In his deeply funny book, exuberantly illustrated in full colour, he shares the story of his own professional evolution, together with lessons on awakening and fostering creative genius.

                            It’s a book about innovation and creativity, but it's written from the perspective of an artist. And it's also written from the perspective of a person, you know? Not an entrepreneur, not a startup, not a venture capitalist, none of that innovation space. But the “I've dedicated my life to this one company” space. The hairball is Hallmark cards, and he teaches you how to orbit and maintain your creativity, maintain your impact, and keep driving innovation and stuff without getting sucked into the vortex. And it's beautiful. Get the hardcopy if you can because he's got little funny little illustrations and stuff.

                        <div class="book-description">Humans did not discover fire – they designed it. Design is not defined by software programs, blueprints, or font choice. When we create new things – technologies, organisations, processes, systems, environments, ways of thinking – we engage in design. With this expansive view of design as their premise, in The Design Way Harold Nelson and Erik Stolterman make the case for design as its own culture of inquiry and action. They offer not a recipe for design practice or theorising but a formulation of design culture's fundamental core of ideas. These ideas are applicable to an infinite variety of design domains, from such traditional fields as architecture and graphic design to such nontraditional design areas as organisational, educational, interaction, and healthcare design.

In Designing Design, he impresses upon the reader the importance of “emptiness” in both the visual and philosophical traditions of Japan and its application to design, made visible by means of numerous examples from his own work.

There is no shortage of books about design, but they tend to either be stories from practice (always nice to read, but hard to relate to your own work) or top-heavy design theory (with no connection to practice at all). This book tries to strike a balance, to reflect deeply and thoroughly on concrete aspects of design. It is both fundamental and oriented towards practice.

                        <div class="book-description">Designers are entrusted with increasingly complex and impactful challenges. However, the current system of design education does not always prepare students for these challenges. When we examine what and how our system teaches young designers, we discover that the most valuable elements of the designer’s perspective and process are seldom taught. Instead, some designers grow beyond their education through their experience working in industry, essentially learning by accident. Meanwhile, skills for developing creative solutions to complex problems are increasingly essential. So, what are we to do? Other learned professions such as medicine, law, and business provide excellent advice and guidance embedded within their own histories of professionalisation. In this article, we borrow from their experiences to recommend a course of action for design.

                        <div class="book-description">Arturo Escobar presents a new vision of design theory and practice aimed at channeling design's world-making capacity toward ways of being and doing that are deeply attuned to justice and the Earth. Noting that most design currently serves capitalist ends, Escobar argues for the development of an “autonomous design” that eschews commercial and modernising aims in favour of more collaborative and placed-based approaches. Such design attends to questions of environment, experience, and politics while focusing on the production of human experience based on the radical interdependence of all beings. Mapping autonomous design’s principles to the history of decolonial efforts of indigenous and Afro-descended people in Latin America, Escobar shows how refiguring current design practices could lead to the creation of more just and sustainable social orders.

                            The changes in play, that are transforming our norms, are not the result of human intention but hopefully, their subsequent consequences can be. Our challenge is thus: how will the norms that become reified be the ones we desire rather than the ones we get by happenstance? For any hope of assuring that the ones realized in the future are desirable – systemic design will be a necessary strategy to use.

                            <br>
                            There are two fundamental approaches to the future – reactive and proactive. A reactive approach ‘backs’ into the future. A proactive approach – a systemic design approach – ‘advances’ into the future. Navigating into a desired future will require new mindsets, knowledge sets, skill sets, and toolsets – new normals. Simply stated: &#8220;We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.&#8221;– Albert Einstein. 
                  <br>
                            <br>From a systemic design perspective, we can reframe Einstein’s admonition by asserting that navigating into a desired future, rather than backing away from an undesired present, requires a qualitatively different stance and approach from what was the norm just yesterday. Having done this we will be able to begin regaining a new sense of well-being.

With the increasing popularity of design thinking and human-centred design we’ve also seen more material discussing various aspects of the practice. One missing aspect, almost in an ironic twist, is what it takes to be the actual person who is doing the designing.

                        <div class="book-description">A revolutionary new explanation for sentience from the neuroscientist who discovered how the brain dreams. How does the mind connect to the body? Why does it feel like something to be us? For one of the boldest thinkers in neuroscience, solving this puzzle has been a lifetime's quest. Now at last, the man who discovered the brain mechanism for dreaming appears to have made a breakthrough. More than just a philosophical argument, The Hidden Spring will forever alter how you understand your own experience. There is a secret buried in the brain's ancient foundations: bring it into the light and we fathom all the depths of our being.

Often, to get something done that really matters to us, we need to work with people we don’t agree with or like or trust. Adam Kahane has faced this challenge many times, working on big issues like democracy and jobs and climate change and on everyday issues in organisations and families. He has learned that our conventional understanding of collaboration – that it requires a harmonious team that agrees on where it’s going, how it’s going to get there, and who needs to do what – is wrong. Instead, we need a new approach to collaboration that embraces discord, experimentation, and genuine co-creation.

                        <div class="book-description">How organisations can use practices developed by expert designers to solve today's open, complex, dynamic, and networked problems. When organisations apply old methods of problem-solving to new kinds of problems, they may accomplish only temporary fixes or some ineffectual tinkering around the edges. Today's problems are a new breed—open, complex, dynamic, and networked – and require a radically different response. Dorst provides tools and methods for implementing frame creation, offering not so much a how-to manual as a do-it-yourself handbook – a guide that will help practitioners develop their own approaches to problem-solving and creating innovation.

In Differences That Make a Difference – the last of his many books – Ackoff determined to distill the wisdom of a lifetime into a "glossary" that would be easily accessible to managers, employees, students, and academics alike. His aim was to dissolve (not solve or resolve) some of the many disputes in professional and private life that revolve around meaning and (mis)understanding.

(We might now recognize him as a design planner.) Even so, Rittel changed the field of design – linking design and politics – and started a line of inquiry which continues today in the field of computer programming and information science—design rationale.

                        <div class="book-description">This book examines the theoretical foundations of the processes of planning and design. When people – alone or in groups – want to solve problems or improve their situation, they make plans. Horst Rittel studied this process of making plans and he developed theories – including his notion of "wicked problems" – that are used in many fields today. From product design, architecture and planning – where Rittel’s work was originally developed – to governmental agencies, business schools and software design, Rittel’s ideas are being used. This book collects previously unavailable work of Rittel’s within the framework of a discussion of Rittel’s theories and philosophical influences.

                        <div class="book-description">The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail, because of the nature of these problems. They are “wicked” problems, whereas science has developed to deal with “tame” problems. Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the undisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about “optimal solutions” to social problems unless severe qualifications are imposed first. Even worse, there are no “solutions” in the sense of definitive and objective answers.

                            On September 5, 2011, Mr. Hiro Nakano interviewed Prof. Christopher Alexander, architect, at his home in Arundel, England. 
                  <br>
                            <br>
                            For nearly 50+ years Alexander has challenged the architectural establishment, sometimes uncomfortably, to pay more attention to the human beings at the center of design. To do so he has combined top-flight scientific training, award-winning architectural research, patient observation and testing throughout his building projects, and a radical but profoundly influential set of ideas that have extended far beyond the realm of architecture.
                  <br>
                            <br>Alexander is widely recognized as the father of the pattern language movement in computer science. He is the recipient of the first medal for research ever given by the American Institute of Architects, and he has been honoured repeatedly for his buildings in many parts of the world. He was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996 for his contributions to architecture, including his groundbreaking work on how the built environment affects the lives of people.

                            Tony Duquette was a Hollywood Designer from the 1940s. His house was used in the Netflix series Ratchet. I was propping my laptop on it for zoom meetings during lockdown, forgetting how extraordinary these interiors are. They are amazing.
