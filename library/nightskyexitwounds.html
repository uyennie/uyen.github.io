            Vuong posseses tremendous control over language – it's evident all the way through the book with how his themes work, how he always paints a picture for you to see, and how he makes the ordinary hold so much magic and heart by way of words. I have nothing to fault in terms of the way these poems were written. Diasporic writing, however, is definitely a sub-genre of literature I’ve grown to...loathe? Don’t get me wrong, I dabbled in ~poetry about missing the homeland~ in my teenage years too, but I am generally partial to works exploring Vietnamese American perspectives on the Vietnam war. That being said, these poems do feel, at some level, contrived (my least favorite phenomenon in poetry), which is why this was bumped down for me to somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.
