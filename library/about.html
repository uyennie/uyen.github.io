            Hello! Uyen is a 22 year old who has always loved reading since they were young (they even did literature in high school. yikes). However, ever since they started university, Uyen's responsibilities have gotten in the way of their love for reading. As an aspiring graphic and web designer, Uyen hopes this project will grow their love for books and coding by cultivating this small corner of the web. Their favourite books are: The Alchemist and Pride and Prejudice. <br>
            Uyen hasn't read many books but graphic novels however... ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ (maybe this can be another site, who knows?) <br>
            Find more of Uyen's work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wingdiengs/">instagram</a> !!
